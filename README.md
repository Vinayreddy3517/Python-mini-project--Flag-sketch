# National Flag of India Drawer Using Python

This Python project is a simple GUI-based application to draw the National Flag of India using **Turtle Graphics** integrated with **Tkinter**. The application provides an interactive button to generate the flag on a canvas, showcasing the colors and design elements of the Indian flag, including the Ashoka Chakra.

## Features
1. **Tkinter GUI Integration**: 
   - A user-friendly interface with a button to trigger the flag drawing.
   - The canvas serves as the drawing area.

2. **Turtle Graphics for Drawing**:
   - The flag's three horizontal bands: saffron, white, and green.
   - The Ashoka Chakra, a blue wheel with 24 spokes, positioned in the center.

3. **Dynamic and Interactive**:
   - Drawing is animated, allowing users to observe each element as it is created.

## Code Highlights
- **Functionality**:
  - The `rect` function simplifies drawing the flag's rectangular bands with specific colors.
  - The Ashoka Chakra is drawn with a combination of a circle and 24 evenly spaced spokes.

- **GUI Components**:
  - A Tkinter `Button` initiates the drawing process.
  - A `Canvas` widget provides the workspace for the flag illustration.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed with the **Turtle** and **Tkinter** libraries (default with Python installation).
2. Save the code to a file, e.g., `indian_flag_drawer.py`.
3. Run the script in your preferred Python environment:
   ```bash
   python indian_flag_drawer.py
   ```
4. Click the **"Draw National Flag"** button to see the Indian flag being drawn on the canvas.
